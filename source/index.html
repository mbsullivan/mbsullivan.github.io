<h2>Interests</h2>

<h3>Approximate Computing</h3>
`default.comment("""<p>The speed and levels of integration of modern devices have risen to the point that arithmetic can be performed in hardware with high precision. While precise arithmetic
is important for some applications, computing past the precision that
applications require wastes power. Novel approximate methods of computation can
save power and latency relative to covnentional arithmetic circuits. There remains plenty of interesting research into the design and application of
approximate arithmetic units.</p>""")`
<p>The speed and levels of integration of modern devices have risen to the point that arithmetic can be performed very fast and with high precision. While precise arithmetic is important for some applications, it comes at a hidden energy cost; by computing most results past the precision they require, systems are inefficiently utilizing their resources.
These inefficiencies will become increasing problematic for future
power-constrained devices. I am interested in the co-design of
<i>precision-aware</i> hardware and software algorithms to create systems with
superior energy efficiency.</p>

<h3>Arithmetic Error Detection</h3>

<p>Rising levels of integration and decreasing component
reliabilities make error protection increasingly important. At the same time, the 
need for energy efficiency necessitates the careful evaluation of 
resilience techniques. Arithmetic error protection is typically more expensive than the protection of memory or data movement, requiring large amounts of redundant logic. Protection of the arithmetic pipeline has correspondingly been reserved for critical or high-availability applications. Current
trends, however, indicate that low-cost arithmetic error detection will be
necessary in the future across more diverse application areas. Towards this end, much of my current research is focused on providing strong, flexible, and low-cost error protection for arithmetic operations.</p>

<h3>Efficient and Reliable Application-Specific Acceleration</h3>

<p>Increasing levels of integration make it so that complex acceleration units can be cost-effectively placed on-chip. This, combined with the ever-increasing need for energy efficient execution, will make the hardware acceleration of specific applications more commonplace. I believe that several of my above interests--namely approximate computation and the error coding of data transformations--have a great deal of overlap with the creation of fast efficient and reliable application-specific accelerators.</p>

<h3>System-Level Reliability</h3>

<p>Reliability and resilience are major obstacles on the road to exascale computing. The growing number of components required for exascale systems and the decreasing inherent
reliability of components in future fabrication technologies conspire to make
reliability a first-order design concern. A strong system-level approach towards reliability is needed in order to efficiently handle errors at all scales. In addition, it is important to enable and exploit cross-layer reliability through system-level mechanisms--there are a plethora of different failures that can occur in a large computer system, and superior efficiency can only be achieved by dealing with every error in the appropriate manner and system layer.</p>
