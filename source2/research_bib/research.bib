Containment domains are a programming construct that enable applications to express resilience needs and to interact with the system to tune and specialize error detection, state preservation and restoration, and recovery schemes. Containment domains have weak transactional semantics and are nested to take advantage of the machine and application hierarchies and to enable hierarchical state preservation, restoration, and recovery.

    ABSTRACT = {Chip multiprocessors enable continued performance scaling with increasingly many cores per chip. As the throughput of computation outpaces available memory bandwidth, however, the system bottleneck will shift to main memory. We present a memory system, the dynamic granularity memory system (DGMS), which avoids unnecessary data transfers, saves power, and improves system performance by dynamically changing between fine and coarse grained memory accesses. DGMS predicts memory access granularities dynamically in hardware, and does not require software or OS support. The dynamic operation of DGMS gives it superior ease of implementation and power efficiency relative to prior multi-granularity memory systems, while maintaining comparable levels of system performance.},

    ABSTRACT = {Off-chip memory systems are currently designed to present a uniform interface to the processor. Applications and systems, however, have dynamic and heterogeneous requirements in terms of reliability and access granularity because of complex usage scenarios and differing spatial locality. We argue that memory systems should be proportional, in that the data transferred and overhead of error protection be proportional to the requirements and characteristics of the running processes. We describe two techniques and specific designs for achieving aspects of proportionality in the main memory system. The first, dynamic and adaptive granularity, utilizes conventional DRAM chips with minor DIMM modifications (along with new control and prediction mechanisms) to access memory with either fine or coarse granularity depending on observed spatial locality. The second, virtualized ECC, is a software/hardware collaborative technique that enables flexible, dynamic, and adaptive tuning between the level of protection provided for a virtual memory page and the overhead of bandwidth and capacity for achieving protection. Both mechanisms have a small hardware overhead, can be disabled to match the baseline, and provide significant benefits when in use.},

These detection mechanisms have different overhead costs in terms of energy, performance, and area, and also differ in their error coverage, complexity, and programmer effort.

In order to achieve the highest efficiency in designing and running a resilient computer system, one must understand the trade-offs among the aforementioned metrics for each detection mechanism and choose the most efficient option for a given running environment. To accomplish such a goal, we first enumerate many error detection techniques previously suggested in the literature.},

    YEAR = {2011},
    ABSTRACT = {Operating the Echelon system at optimal energy efficiency under a wide range of environmental conditions and operating scenarios requires a comprehensive and flexible resiliency solution. Our research is focused in on two main directions: providing mechanisms for proportional resiliency which use application-tunable hardware/software cooperative error detection and recovery, and enabling hierarchical state preservation and restoration as an alternative to non-scalable and inefficient generic checkpoint and restart. As an interface to these orthogonal research areas, we are developing and evaluating programming constructs based on the concept of Containment Domains. Containment Domains enable the programmer and software system to interact with the hardware and establish a hierarchical organization for preserving necessary state, multi-granularity error detection, and minimal re-execution. Containment domains also empower the programmer to reason about resiliency and utilize domain knowledge to improve efficiency beyond what compiler analysis can achieve without such information. This report describes our initial framework and focuses more on the aspects relating to enabling efficient state preservation and restoration.},

Low-cost, single-cycle residue generators can be readily formed out of two’s complement adders in two ways, which have area and delay tradeoffs. A residue generator using adderincrementers for end-around-carry adders is small but slow, and a design using carry-select adders is fast, but large. It is shown that a hybrid combination of both approaches is more efficient than either.},

Exact logarithmic (and anti-logarithmic) conversion is prohibitively expensive for use in general multipliers; however, inexpensive estimate conversions can be used to perform approximate multiplication. Such approximate multipliers have been used in domain-specific applications, but existing designs either offer superior efficiency or flexibility. This study proposes a flexible approximate multiplier with improved efficiency. Preliminary analysis indicates that this design provides up to a 50\% efficiency advantage relative to prior flexible approximate multipliers.},

Precise arithmetic comes at a hidden cost--by computing results past the precision they require, systems inefficiently utilize their resources. Numerous designs over the past fifty years have demonstrated scalable efficiency by utilizing approximate logarithms. Many such designs are based off of a linear approximation algorithm developed by Mitchell. This paper evaluates a truncated form of binary logarithm as a replacement for Mitchell's algorithm. The <i>truncated approximate logarithm</i> simultaneously improves the efficiency and precision of Mitchell's approximation while remaining simple to implement.},

    BOOKTITLE = HPCA,
    YEAR = {2012},
    PAGES = {1--12},
    ABSTRACT = {Modern memory systems rely on spatial locality to provide high bandwidth while minimizing memory device power and cost. The trend of increasing the number of cores that share memory, however, decreases apparent spatial locality because access streams from independent threads are interleaved. Memory access scheduling recovers only a fraction of the original locality because of buffering limits. We investigate new techniques to reduce inter-thread access interference. We propose to partition the internal memory banks between cores to isolate their access streams and eliminate locality interference. We implement this by extending the physical frame allocation algorithm of the OS such that physical frames mapped to the same DRAM bank can be exclusively allocated to a single thread. We compensate for the reduced bank-level parallelism of each thread by employing memory sub-ranking to effectively increase the number of independent banks. This combined approach, unlike memory bank partitioning or sub-ranking alone, simultaneously increases overall performance and significantly reduces memory power consumption.},

    BOOKTITLE = MICRO,
    YEAR = {2013},
    PAGES = {86--98},
    ABSTRACT = {As GPU's compute capabilities grow, their memory hierarchy increasingly becomes a bottleneck. Current GPU memory hierarchies use coarse-grained memory accesses to exploit spatial locality, maximize peak bandwidth, simplify control, and reduce cache meta-data storage. These coarse-grained memory accesses, however, are a poor match for emerging GPU applications with irregular control flow and memory access patterns. Meanwhile, the massive multi-threading of GPUs and the simplicity of their cache hierarchies make CPU-specific memory system enhancements ineffective for improving the performance of irregular GPU applications. We design and evaluate a locality-aware memory hierarchy for throughput processors, such as GPUs. Our proposed design retains the advantages of coarse-grained accesses for spatially and temporally local programs while permitting selective fine-grained access to memory. By adaptively adjusting the access granularity, memory bandwidth and energy are reduced for data with low spatial/temporal locality without wasting control overheads or prefetching potential for data with high spatial locality. As such, our locality-aware memory hierarchy improves GPU performance, energy-efficiency, and memory throughput for a large range of applications.},

    AUTHOR = {Jungrae Kim and Michael Sullivan and Mattan Erez},
    BOOKTITLE = HPCA,
    YEAR = {2015},
    ABSTRACT = {Growing computer system sizes and levels of integration have made memory reliability a primary concern, necessitating strong memory error protection. As such, large-scale systems typically employ error checking and correcting codes to trade redundant storage and bandwidth for increased reliability. While stronger memory protection will be needed to meet reliability targets in the future, it is undesirable to further increase the amount of storage and bandwidth spent on redundancy. We propose a novel family of single-tier ECC mechanisms called Bamboo ECC to simultaneously address the conflicting requirements of increasing reliability while maintaining or decreasing error protection overheads.

Relative to the state-of-the-art single-tier error protection, Bamboo ECC codes have superior correction capabilities, all but eliminate the risk of silent data corruption, and can also increase redundancy at a fine granularity, enabling more adaptive graceful downgrade schemes. These strength, safety, and flexibility advantages translate to a significantly more reliable memory system. To demonstrate this, we evaluate a family of Bamboo ECC organizations in the context of conventional 72b and 144b DRAM channels and show the significant error coverage and memory lifespan improvements of Bamboo ECC relative to existing SEC-DED, chipkill-correct and double-chipkill-correct schemes.},

    ABSTRACT = {Rising levels of integration, decreasing component reliabilities, and the ubiquity of computer systems make error protection a rising concern. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of future fault and error modes motivates the design of strong error detection mechanisms that offer fault-agnostic error protection. Current concurrent hardware mechanisms, however, either offer strong error detection coverage at high cost, or restrict their coverage to narrow synthetic error modes. This paper investigates the potential for duplication using alternate number systems to lower the costs of duplicated multiplication without sacrificing error coverage. An example of such a low-cost duplication scheme is described and evaluated; it is shown that specialized carry-save checking can be used to increase the efficiency of duplicated multiplication.},

These nanoscale effects are all caused by the presence of permanent surface charges on the walls of the pore. Here we report a new phenomenon in which the addition of small amounts of divalent cations to a buffered monovalent ionic solution results in an oscillating ionic current through a conical nanopore. This behaviour is caused by the transient formation and redissolution of nanoprecipitates, which temporarily block the ionic current through the pore. The frequency and character of ionic current instabilities are regulated by the potential across the membrane and the chemistry of the precipitate. We discuss how oscillating nanopores could be used as model systems for studying nonlinear electrochemical processes and the early stages of crystallization in sub-femtolitre volumes. Such nanopore systems might also form the basis for a stochastic sensor.},

    BOOKTITLE = SC,
    YEAR = {2015},
    CATEGORIES = {mem, rel},
    ABSTRACT = {Because main memory is vulnerable to errors and failures, large-scale systems and critical servers utilize error checking and correcting (ECC) mechanisms to meet their reliability requirements. We propose a novel mechanism, Frugal ECC (FECC), that combines ECC with fine-grained compression to provide versatile protection that can be both stronger and lower overhead than current schemes, without sacrificing performance. FECC compresses main memory at cache-block granularity, using any left over space to store ECC information. Compressed data and its ECC information are then frequently read with a single access even without redundant memory chips; blocks that do not compress sufficiently require additional storage and accesses.  As examples of FECC, we present chipkill-correct and chipkill-level ECCs on a 64-bit non-ECC DIMM with ×4 DRAM chips. We also describe the first true chipkill-correct ECC for ×8 devices using conventional ECC DIMMs. FECC relies on a new Coverage-oriented Compression (CoC) scheme that we developed specifically for the modest compression needs of ECC and for floating-point data. CoC can sufficiently compress 84\% of all accesses in SPEC Int, 93\% in SPEC FP, 95\% in SPLASH2X, and nearly 100\% in the NPB suites. With such high compression coverage, the worst case performance degradation from FECC is less than 3.7\% while reliability is slightly improved and energy consumption reduced by about 50\% for true chipkill-correct.},
